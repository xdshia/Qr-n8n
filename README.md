# n8n QR Code Generator

This n8n workflow generates a QR code from a given URL and outputs the QR code as an image. It's useful for automating the creation of QR codes based on incoming webhooks, forms, or other triggers.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts a URL via webhook or manual input
- Generates a QR code image using n8n's built-in nodes
- Returns the image as a response or stores it (optional)
- Can be integrated into automation pipelines

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Trigger**  
   Use a **Webhook** or **Form Trigger** node to start the workflow.

2. **URL Input**  
   Extract the URL from the incoming data (e.g., `{{$json["url"]}}`).

3. **QR Code Generation**  
   Use the **HTTP Request** or a **Custom Function** node to call a QR generation API or use a JavaScript function to generate the base64 image.

4. **Output**  
   - Return the QR code as an image
   - Optionally store in a file system, Google Drive, or cloud storage

## üì¶ Sample Nodes Overview

```yaml
- Webhook (POST)  
- Set (to extract `url`)  
- HTTP Request (to generate QR code from API like `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data=...`)  
- Binary Data (convert to image if needed)  
- Respond with Image (optional)
